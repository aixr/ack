### Ackposts
This repository contains the 3 disassembled classes of a piece of Android malware called Ackposts. All the annotations are done by me and they aim to show the process I went through when I was trying to work out what each piece of the code meant when performing the static analysis.

### Research Poster
The research poster shows the process I went through to reverse engineer Ackposts in order to understand what it was doing.

### Useful Resources
These are some helpful webpages that I used to learn how to analyse the disassembled code.<br>
